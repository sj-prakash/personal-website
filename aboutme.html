                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I have been interested in tech almost ever since i got hands on my first gameboy, and have always been fond of it.</p>
                <p>My newest interest is Linux administration and self-hosting.</p>
                <p>I have experience using AWS, MySQL, Mongodb, Apache. </p>
                <p>For operating systems I have experience with Ubuntu, Debian, Arch Linux, Mint, Centos, Windows.</p>
                <p>That being said, I am not a professional Linux administrator, but I am a Linux enthusiast. I have adequate experience with Linux and I'm always trying to learn more.</p>

                    <h2>How I got into open-source</h2>
                    <p>It all started when I first heard about <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/"><strong>LibreOffice</strong></a>, an open-source alternative to Microsoft Office.</p>
                    <p>Then I started to delve more into open-source operating systems and softwares. Exploring distributions like <a href="https://ubuntu.com/"><strong>Ubuntu</strong></a> and libre softwares broadened my understanding of the movement's impact on software and user freedoms.</p>
                    <p>At first I kind of ignored it and went straight into installing Ubuntu, but then my curiosity got the best of me and I looked it up to what it was.</p>
                    <p>I was instantly hooked (It was something like self-hosted email) and began installing it on my laptop. Now please note that I had no prior experience of installing OS at all. </p>
                    <p>That very night as I was installing it, I also started to explore open-source custom roms for Andriod phones.</p>
                    <p>I went and pulled out my old Oneplus X that I had lying around and installed <a href="https://cyanogenmodroms.com/">CyanogenMod</a> Rom on that.</p>
                    <p>During this journey I stumbled upon the most secure custom rom for Andriod - <strong><a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a></strong>.</p>
                    <p>I had a lot of fun with it and it was a great learning experience. I was able to install many apps and servies that I had no idea existed before. </p>
                    <p>Thus, began the exploration of FOSS softwares and OS.</p>
